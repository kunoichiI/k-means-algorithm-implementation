# k-means-algorithm-implementation

This is a K_means algorithm implementation which uses a test_data.txt as input and output.txt as its output.
The first step is to initialize program with k centroids, chosen randomly from points in test_data.txt.
Then start clustering using k_means algorithm.
K is a parameter given by users. The default value is 5(for reference)

This program includes a method to calculate SSE(Sum of Squared Error).
